- concentrated Liquidity (deriviatives)
  - MEV protection stuffs
  - Impernanent loss protection
- options trading and options (options trading engine)
  - Black scholes, American Options, European Options , expiration and non expiry options models
  - Liquidation Mechanism
  - Liquidation bot/engine in python
- perp trading models/engine
- Dynamic Fee system
- Limit orders
- Where does frax,sFrax come in ? -> Frax ecosystem (FXS,sFRAX,sfrxETH,FXTL) FRAX & sFRAX
  - collateral , reward
  - New veFXS lockers, veFXS LSDs, veFXS utility since there is no whitelist anymore to stake veFXS.
- FlashLoan system
- Handling slippage

### Hackathon Ideas (not required but likely to do well in judging)

- New and innovative perpetual protocols that leverage sFRAX yield as collateral.
- Memecoin platforms such as pump.fun but for the Fraxtal ecosystem.
- New veFXS lockers, veFXS LSDs, veFXS utility since there is no whitelist anymore to stake veFXS.
- OP Superchain powered applications
- Fixed Yield Tokenization Protocols Similar to Pendle and Hourglass
- Restaking protocols that integrate FXS and any Frax Asset as base restaked assets, including veFXS as a restaked asset since veFXS can now be slashed.
- Stablecoin payment rails/yield apps that integrate FRAX & sFRAX.

- L3 Appchains - Work with leading RaaS providers to build L3s and appchains uniquely leveraging Frax Assets such as privacy optimized, high-throughput payment L3s for sending stablecoin payments anonymously.

## List architecture first , all internal and external functions

- WhitePaper -> Mathematical models / desmos -> Architecture -> coding
- assembly, etc
- File structure plan
- Architecture plan and layout
- Fuzz Tests
