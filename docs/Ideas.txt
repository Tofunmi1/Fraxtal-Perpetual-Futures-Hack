## We can use callbacks to execute Strategies in the Concentrated Liqudity pool
## Or use a seperate Pool to connect all Pools together
## name all internal functions first, before implemanting

### Hackathon Ideas (not required but likely to do well in judging)

- New and innovative perpetual protocols that leverage sFRAX yield as collateral.
- Memecoin platforms such as pump.fun but for the Fraxtal ecosystem.
- New veFXS lockers, veFXS LSDs, veFXS utility since there is no whitelist anymore to stake veFXS.

- Fixed Yield Tokenization Protocols Similar to Pendle and Hourglass
- Restaking protocols that integrate FXS and any Frax Asset as base restaked assets, including veFXS as a restaked asset since veFXS can now be slashed.
- Stablecoin payment rails/yield apps that integrate FRAX & sFRAX.
- Frax Simplified Farming Front Ends/Mobile Apps, maximize FXTL, FXS, sFRAX, sfrxETH, FXB yields.
- Fraxtal vault strategies that create delta-neutral positions & harvest yield for users similar to Yearn vaults.
